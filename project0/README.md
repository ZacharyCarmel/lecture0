# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

In Project0, I created a web site for a fictional hamburger restaurant, showcasing a number of pages you would typically see on this kind of website, including a home page, an image gallery, a testimonials page, and a page offering catering services.

At the top of each page, I put a navigation bar for easy access to all of the website.

On the home page, I created a banner to welcome visitors to the site, including an Explore button which sends users directly to the gallery.

The gallery contains several images of the restaurant's burgers arranged in flexboxes.

The menu page shows appetisers, mains, and desserts which I arranged through container classes.

The testimonials pages utilises tables to display fictional feedback to the restaurant.

The catering page simply has a banner and some centred text.

Every page has a footer and footer images.
